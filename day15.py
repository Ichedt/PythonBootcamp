Day 15 - Coffee Machine Project

Description: This is a simulation of a coffee machine, which includes three flavours, their ingredients and their price. The coffee machine has its own resources that need to be managed in order to produce the coffees. Also, the machine is operated by coins. As requirements, the machine must report its resources and warn the user when there's not enough resources to produce the coffee.
